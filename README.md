- 👋 Hi, I’m @hanzz91! I have ~3 years C/C++ development experience in a professional setting, and ~2 years of Java development experience in an academic setting.

- 👀 I’m interested in contributing to some cool open source projects, learning along the way, and meeting some awesome new people!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning embedded software development for an RTOS (VxWorks) and GUI development for Linux at my day job.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects of any type. Projects using embedded software or space-related applications are of particular interest to me
